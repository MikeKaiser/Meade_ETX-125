# Meade_ETX-125
Project to convert a Meade ETX-125 telescope into a fully standalone star tracker that works.

Years ago, I bought a Meade ETX-125 with an AutoStar handset. From day one, the alignment procedure didn't work.

Initially, I thought I was just being a bit rubbish at following the instructions but slowly, I began to realise that there might be a real problem with the telescope.
Even just telling the AutoStar to point north would result in it slewing to a direction that was very far from north.

This project is an attempt to create a controller for the telescope that will have GPS, compass, accelerometer and camera to facilitate calibration.
It will be able to control the horzontal and vertical axes as well as focus adjustment.
